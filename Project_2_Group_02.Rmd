## Introduction

Density-based spacial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is a clustering technique that uses certain aspects of a dataset to form groups of data points.


## When Is This Useful? 

DBSCAN is unique from other clustering applications, such as K-means, in the sense that instead of the user choosing the number of clusters, DBSCAN does it for the user. Also, DBSCAN is not bound by certain shapes of data, meaning if the dataset itself seems off, DBSCAN can still be used. Finally, DBSCAN is resistant to outliers.
